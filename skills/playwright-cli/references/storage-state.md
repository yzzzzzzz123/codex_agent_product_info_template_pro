# Storage Management

Manage cookies, LocalStorage, sessionStorage, and browser storage state.

## Storage State

Save and restore complete browser state including cookies and storage.

```bash
# Save to auto-generated filename (storage-state-{timestamp}.json)
playwright-cli state-save

# Save to specific file
playwright-cli state-save my-state.json

# Load storage state
playwright-cli state-load my-state.json
```

Storage state file format:

```json
{
  "cookies": [
    {
      "name": "session_id",
      "value": "abc123",
      "domain": "example.com",
      "path": "/",
      "expires": 1755689600,
      "httpOnly": true,
      "secure": true,
      "sameSite": "Lax"
    }
  ],
  "origins": [
    {
      "origin": "https://example.com",
      "localStorage": [
        { "name": "theme", "value": "dark" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Cookies

### List All Cookies

```bash
playwright-cli cookie-list
playwright-cli cookie-list --domain=example.com
```

### Get a Single Cookie

```bash
playwright-cli cookie-get session_id
```

### Set a Cookie

```bash
# Basic cookie
playwright-cli cookie-set session abc123

# Cookie with options
playwright-cli cookie-set session abc123 \
  --domain=example.com --path=/ --httpOnly --secure --sameSite=Lax

# Cookie with expiration (Unix timestamp)
playwright-cli cookie-set remember_me token123 --expires=1735689600
```

### Delete a Cookie

```bash
playwright-cli cookie-delete session_id
```

### Clear ALL Cookies

```bash
playwright-cli cookie-clear
```

### Advanced: Multiple Cookies via run-code

```bash
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.context().addCookies([
    { name: 'session_id', value: 'sess_abc123', domain: 'example.com', path: '/', httpOnly: true },
    { name: 'preferences', value: JSON.stringify({ theme: 'dark' }), domain: 'example.com', path: '/' }
  ]);
}"
```

## Local Storage

### List All localStorage Items

```bash
playwright-cli localstorage-list
```

### Get Single Value

```bash
playwright-cli localstorage-get theme
```

### Set Value

```bash
playwright-cli localstorage-set theme dark
playwright-cli localstorage-set settings '{"theme":"dark","language":"en"}'
```

### Delete Value

```bash
playwright-cli localstorage-delete theme
```

### Advanced: Multiple Operations

For complex scenarios like setting multiple values at once, use `run-code`:

```bash
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.evaluate(() => {
    localStorage.setItem('token', 'jwt_abc123');
    localStorage.setItem('user_id', '12345');
    localStorage.setItem('expires_at', Date.now() + 3600000);
  });
}"
```

## Session Storage

### List All sessionStorage Items

```bash
playwright-cli sessionstorage-list
```

### Get Single Value

```bash
playwright-cli sessionstorage-get form_data
```

### Set Value

```bash
playwright-cli sessionstorage-set step 3
```

### Delete Value

```bash
playwright-cli sessionstorage-delete step
```

### Clear sessionStorage

```bash
playwright-cli sessionstorage-clear
```

## IndexedDB

### List Databases

```bash
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  return await page.evaluate(async () => {
    const databases = await indexedDB.databases();
    return databases;
  });
}"
```

### Delete Database

```bash
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.evaluate(() => {
    indexedDB.deleteDatabase('myDatabase');
  });
}"
```

## Common Patterns

### Authentication State Reuse

```bash
# Step 1: Login and save state
playwright-cli open https://app.example.com/login
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli fill e1 "user@example.com"
playwright-cli fill e2 "password123"
playwright-cli click e3

# Save the authenticated state
playwright-cli state-save auth.json

# Step 2: Later, restore state and skip login
playwright-cli state-load auth.json
playwright-cli open https://app.example.com/dashboard
# Already logged in!
```

### Save and Restore Roundtrip

```bash
# Set up authentication state
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli eval "() => { document.cookie = 'session=abc123'; localStorage.setItem('user', 'alice'); }"

# Save state to file
playwright-cli state-save my-session.json

# Later, in a new session...
# Restore state
playwright-cli state-load my-session.json
playwright-cli open https://example.com
# Cookies and Local Storage are restored!
```

## Security Notes

- Never commit storage state files containing auth tokens
- Add `*auth-state.json` and `*storage-state*.json` to `.gitignore`
- Delete storage state files after automation begins sensitive operations
- Use `delete-data` to clear persistent browser profiles when finished
